### Hi there, I'm David Lupau 👋

I'm an experienced professional with over 20 years in Learning and Development (LnD), deeply passionate about AI and new technologies. In February 2023, I embarked on an exciting career change, diving into the world of Data Science. With a rich background in managing extensive learning program data, I've developed a keen interest in unlocking the vast potential hidden within data through careful analysis and application.

#### 📚 Academic Journey & Skills Development
Currently, I am enrolled in a BSc in Data Science, where my journey began with an immersive dive into mathematics and statistics. I've recently ventured into learning Python and SQL, finding both the challenge and the practical application of these languages incredibly rewarding. The transition from theory to practice in data science has been a thrilling part of my learning journey.

#### 💻 Current Projects
- **Habit Tracker App**: Developed a Habit Tracker App. This project is a practical application of my growing skills in Python and SQL, allowing me to explore data collection and analysis in everyday life.
- **Data Mart in SQL**: Developed and documented an entity relationship model (ERM) and a normalized SQL database for an Airbnb-like rental platform.
- **Machine Learning**: I am currently learning about Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning.

#### 🎯 Future Goals
As I continue to explore the vast and varied landscapes of data science, my primary goal is to evolve into a proficient Data Scientist. I am particularly fascinated by the diverse disciplines and skills involved in data science and am eager to apply my knowledge across different business domains.
